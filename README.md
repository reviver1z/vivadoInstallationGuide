During the creation of the Block Diagram, you may need to customize the IP you use to fit the requirements of your design.
1. Edit IP: Select the IP in the Block Design and edit its settings if necessary to be compatible with your requirements.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================
**Module 5: Synthesis and Implementation
Description of the Synthesis and Implementation Process**
The process of synthesis and implementation is critical in the development of FPGA systems, as it involves converting your design into a real, professional, programmable system. This process includes synthesizing the code into a processing core, configuring the system clock, and selecting the components that will be used.
1. Synthesis: During the synthesis process, the VHDL or Verilog code is converted into an intermediate representation, which depicts the logical operation of the system. The processing core to be used for the implementation of the design is selected during synthesis.
2. Implementation: In the implementation process, the intermediate code is converted into a processing core, while the code is mapped to the FPGA's logical resources. This includes placing the code on the interconnected logical elements of the FPGA and connecting the interconnects.

**Automatic Component Selection**
In the implementation process, Vivado provides automatic component selection features, as it tries to find the best way to implement your design on the selected FPGA. This includes selecting processing cores, internal interconnections, and routing paths.

**Manual Configuration and Customization of the System Clock**
While automatic component selection is useful, manual configuration and customization may also be required to achieve specific requirements. This includes configuring the system clock to achieve the required operating frequency or adjusting the routing paths for optimal performance.

With these steps, you have completed the process of synthesis and implementation of your design in Vivado. This marks the final phase before the creation of the Bitstream, which is the file that can be programmed into the FPGA.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================
**Module 6: Bitstream Generation
Instructions for creating the Bitstream**

Creating the Bitstream is the final step before programming the FPGA. The Bitstream is the file that contains the programming of your design on the FPGA. Below are the basic instructions for creating the Bitstream:
1. Open the Project: Open your project in Vivado if it is not already open.
2. Select "Generate Bitstream": From the Project Manager, choose the "Generate Bitstream" process. This will initiate the Bitstream creation process.
3. Follow the Instructions: Follow the instructions and settings that appear during the Bitstream generation process. It is important to confirm that your settings are correct before proceeding.
4. Wait for Completion: The Bitstream generation process will take time, depending on the size and complexity of your design. Wait until the process is complete.

**Storing the Bitstream in a Suitable Location**

Once the Bitstream generation is complete, you must save it to a suitable location before you program it onto the FPGA. Here are some steps for storing the Bitstream:
1. Select the Bitstream File: From the Bitstream generation process, select the Bitstream file that was created.
2. Choose the Location: Choose the location where you want to save the Bitstream. Typically, this will be a directory or folder on your computer.
